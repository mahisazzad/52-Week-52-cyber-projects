# 🛡️ File Integrity Checker — Week 3 of #52Weeks52CyberProjects

A Python tool to detect file tampering using SHA-256 hashing. This project demonstrates how to baseline a file’s hash, simulate tampering, and verify integrity — all in one script.

## ✅ Features

- Calculates SHA-256 hash of a target file
- Saves baseline hash to a JSON file
- Compares current hash against baseline to detect changes
- Includes tester functions to simulate tampering and restoration
- Prints clear status messages for each step

## 🧠 Why This Project?

File integrity is a cornerstone of cybersecurity. This project helped me explore:

- Cryptographic hashing with `hashlib`
- Secure baseline storage using JSON
- Practical integrity checks for real-world use cases
- Tampering simulation and recovery workflows

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Reads the original file content
2. Calculates and stores its SHA-256 hash
3. Simulates tampering by appending content
4. Compares current hash to baseline
5. Restores original content and rechecks integrity
