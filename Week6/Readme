# ⌨️ Python Keylogger with Pynput

This Week 6 project in the #52Weeks52CyberProjects series is a lightweight Python keylogger built using the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes — including special keys — and logs them to a local file in the user's Documents directory. Designed for educational and ethical use only, this project demonstrates how input monitoring works at a low level.

## 📦 Features

- Captures all keystrokes in real time  
- Logs both character keys and special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Shift)  
- Stores logs in a safe, user-accessible path (`~/Documents/keylog.txt`)  
- Runs silently in the background using `pynput.keyboard.Listener`  
- Minimal and cross-platform (Windows/Linux)
