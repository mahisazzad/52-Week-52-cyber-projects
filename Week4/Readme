🛡️ Nmap Port Scanner in Python
A lightweight Python wrapper around Nmap for scanning hosts, detecting services, and exploring open ports — perfect for learning the basics of network reconnaissance.

🔍 What It Does
Scans a target IP using Nmap’s -sV and -sC options

Lists hostnames, states, protocols, and port details

Parses and prints scan results in a readable format

Uses the python-nmap library for integration

🧠 How It Works
The script uses Nmap’s scanning engine via Python bindings:

-sV: Detects service versions

-sC: Runs default Nmap scripts

Results are parsed using nmap.PortScanner()

Output includes host status, protocols, and port states

Example target: 45.33.32.156

🛠 Usage

import nmap

nm = nmap.PortScanner()
target = "45.33.32.156"
options = "-sV -sC"

nm.scan(target, arguments=options)

for host in nm.all_hosts():
    print("Host: %s (%s)" % (host, nm[host].hostname()))
    print("State: %s" % nm[host].state())
    for protocol in nm[host].all_protocols():
        print("Protocol: %s" % protocol)
        port_info = nm[host][protocol]
        for port, state in port_info.items():
            print("Port: %s\tState: %s" % (port, state))

⚠️ Note
Always scan responsibly. Only use this tool on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
