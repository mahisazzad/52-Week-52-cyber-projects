# 🔐 Secure User Authentication System (Flask + Argon2)

A minimal yet secure user registration and login system built with Flask, SQLite, and Argon2id password hashing. Designed for educational and real-world use, this project demonstrates best practices in password storage, salting, and authentication workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User registration and login with email + password
- 🔐 Passwords hashed using **Argon2id** (memory-hard, salted)
- 🧂 Unique salt per password (handled by Argon2)
- 🧊 Optional pepper support for added security
- 🗄️ SQLite database with secure schema
- 🧠 Rate-limiting stub to prevent brute-force login attempts
- 🧼 Clean UI with inline HTML templates
- 🧪 Easy to extend for email verification, password reset, or JWT

## 🧠 Security Notes

- Argon2id includes a unique salt per password — no need to store it separately.
- Optional pepper can be added via environment variable: `AUTH_PEPPER`
- Password hashes are stored as long strings like: `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=2$...`
- Never store plaintext passwords. Never log them. Never email them.
