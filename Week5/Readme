# 🕵️‍♂️ Python Packet Sniffer with Credential Detection

This project is a lightweight Python-based packet sniffer built using Scapy. It captures HTTP traffic on a specified network interface and detects potential credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords) in raw payloads. It also includes a local test server and traffic simulator for safe, offline testing.

---

## 📦 Features

- Sniffs HTTP requests in real time
- Extracts and prints host + path from HTTP headers
- Detects credential-like patterns in raw payloads
- Works with WinPcap/Npcap interfaces on Windows
- Includes local server and traffic simulator for testing

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-sniffer.git
cd packet-sniffer
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install scapy requests
```

### 3. Run the sniffer (as Administrator)

```powershell
python packet_sniffer.py -i "<your_interface_name>"
```

Use `list_interfaces.py` to find your interface name:
```powershell
python list_interfaces.py
```

---

## 🧪 Local Testing (No Internet Required)

### Step 1: Start the local server

```powershell
python local_server.py
```

### Step 2: Simulate login traffic

```powershell
python simulate_local_login.py
```

### Expected output from sniffer:

```
[+] HTTP Request >> localhost:8080/
[+] Possible credential >> username=admin&password=hunter2
```

| File                     | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `packet_sniffer.py`      | Main sniffer script                          |
| `list_interfaces.py`     | Lists available capture interfaces           |
| `local_server.py`        | Simple HTTP server for POST testing          |
| `simulate_local_login.py`| Sends fake login requests to local server    |

## ⚠️ Notes

- Requires **Administrator privileges** to sniff packets on Windows
- Only captures **unencrypted HTTP traffic** (not HTTPS)
- Best used in **controlled environments** for educational purposes
